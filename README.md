# studentslist

Generates a table with all the students' data and includes pagination. The implementation uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

All data comes from an array of objects, simulating the result of a SQL query.
The table displays the students' names, last names, IDs, and photos.

Clicking on a student's photo generates a table with the student's hobbies and credited classes.
